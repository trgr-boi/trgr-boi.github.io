        Hi, <br /><br />
        My name is <b>**TRGR**</b>. This is my personal website where I can do
        wathever I want. I am a 23-years-old guy with a bachelor in Graphic
        design, with a passion for music and some coding as well. <br /><br />

        Got my bachelor last year at
        <a
            href="https://www.luca-arts.be/nl/grafisch-ontwerp-campus-gent-sint-lucas-bachelor"
            >LUCA School of Arts Ghent.</a
        >
        <br />
        Now doing a bachelor Computer Science at
        <a
            href="https://www.hogent.be/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/"
            >HoGent</a
        >. <br /><br />

        I am a human from <i>*Belgium*</i> who likes to make all kinds of stuff.
        I’m quite busy with school at the moment but I still manage to find some
        time to work on personal projects.<br />
        I do all sorts of projects. Like making all types of sound, from bleep
        bloops to bonk bonk. And projects that make pixels and computers talk,
        like the project you are looking at. <br /><br />

        I want to make this website a place where I can share my projects and
        ideas. For now you can find some of the notes I want to share in the
        <i>*TRGR-Notes.exe*</i> page. There is not a whole lot but it will fill
        over time. <br /><br />
        I’ve been working on and remaking this site a lot but I think I finally
        managed to find a design and structure that I like! If you want to know
        more about it, go to the <i>*about.page.md*</i> section.<br /><br />
        For now, enjoy what is here! <br /><br />
