    <h1># The importance of goals</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>## Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Everyone has things that they want to achieve. For some, this is a
        concept that they have stored somewhere, others write it down in great
        detail. I myself have always been someone who lived a fairly aimless
        life, but noticed that I did not get much done because of this. I always
        wanted to grab the easy way because I did not think about next month,
        let alone tomorrow. A few years ago I started wanting to achieve more.
        Wanting to start thinking longer term than the next few hours. But it
        still remained difficult to set goals. I kept doing easy & short things,
        but the tasks that I gave myself that could not be done in one day were
        still never finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around this time I started taking more and more notes. Instead of trying
        to remember everything in my head only to forget it, I gave the task of
        remembering to a notebook. The only thing I had to remember was to look
        in the notebook. This already helped a lot with getting specific tasks
        done, but it was still difficult to get big tasks done. I didn't know
        where to start or lost the motivation to keep working on it. This was
        because I still couldn't think/visualize long term. For this I created a
        "goal system" that has been in use for some time now.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following system I can split up large tasks/goals in smaller ones
        without losing the overview. It is a very general system because I have
        noticed that everyone has to create their own methods. For some very
        complex systems work, but for most they have to be as simple as
        possible.
    </p>

    <h2>## Different types of goals</h2>

    <p>
        Goals come in different "flavours". I split them up into 2 variants.
        Broad goals and specific goals. These speak for themselves I think.
    </p>
    <p>
        Broad goals are meant to get an overview of what you want to achieve in
        the long term. Goals can be found by asking questions such as;
    </p>
    <p>
        > What do I want to do?<br />
        > What do I want to achieve?<br />
        > What do I want the as result?
    </p>
    <p>
        These are important to not lose the big picture, to give motivation by
        rereading these goals and to know where you want to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other type are specific goals. They are meant to have an overview of
        exact tasks that need to be done. This can be as simple as "clean my
        room" or be part of a broad goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take for example the goal "I want to find a good job that I am happy
        with." This is something very broad, which makes it very difficult to
        know where to start. For this, the specific goal "I want to find out
        which of my hobbies is the most realistic to make a job out of." can be
        useful. This supports the broad goal but gives a more concrete step to
        achieve this goal. This can then be split up into even more specific
        steps; "See what I could do with hobby A."
    </p>
    <p>
        Each broad goal therefore has multiple specific goals, and these can
        therefore have their own more specific goals. In this way you create a
        clear step-by-step plan without losing the overall picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you were to visualize this, it would almost start to look like a mind
        map.

    <p>
        One of the most important things to do is to reread your goals
        regularly. I didn't do this enough, which meant I never had the
        motivation to finish them.
    </p>

    <h2>## Key takeaway</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Goals are important for knowing where you want to go.</li>
        <li>The more specific goals are, the easier they are to execute.</li>
        <li>
            Less is more! The easier it is to use, the more you will use it.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Believe me, I am the king of making overly complex systems. But
                they usually get more in the way than they are usefull.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Specific goals are (usually) part of a broader goal.</li>
        <li>It's about the goals, not the system they are in.</li>
        <li>Goals should be revisited as much as possible.</li>
    </ul>
