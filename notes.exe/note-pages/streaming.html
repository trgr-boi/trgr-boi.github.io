        All music is starting to sound similar. Everyone is listening to the
        same shit And music in general had become something 'ambient'. How many
        songs do you actually know by name or by hearth? Or do you need to look
        trough your playlist in order to give recommendations?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not saying that ambient music is something bad, I really love making
        and listening ambient, but it has to be abmient with the purpose of
        being ambient. All music now had to be able to work in the background
        and almost no music is trying to be truly offencive so it does not work
        against the algorithm.

        Just do a quick [[<a

        We praise the fast growth streaming and algorithms offer without
        actually knowing if it is a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the industry is trying to make us forget about 'owership'. They
        sell the idea of being able to listen to a lot of music instead of
        owning a smaller but more valuable collection.

        Digging The Greats did a good video series about going back to an iPod
        and re-discovered a bunch of shit about streaming. I highlyrecommend it!

        He goes on an interesting tangent about algorithms and the issue with
        them and recommended the book: [[<a
