    <p>Instead of being who we are, we show who we want to be.</p>
    <p>
        There is no issue with wanting to be a better person, but a disconnect
        is created by showing who you want to be as if you were that person.
        This, in my opinion, leads to discomfort and insecurity about who you
        are.
    </p>
    <p>
        We become more and more conscious about how we look or are perceived.
        This in combination with our disconnect with who we truly are leads to
        feeling that we are the most righteous and judge anyone who we perceive
        as less.
    </p>
    <p>
        The equator flows through our behind, but we should never forget that
        we, as an individual, are not the world.
